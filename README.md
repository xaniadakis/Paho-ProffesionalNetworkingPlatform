# Proffesional-Networking-Platform

The aim of this work was to develop a professional networking application. 

The application was developed in cooperation with [Jim Papadimas](https://github.com/aricatosenpai) as Backend Engineer and myself as Frontend Engineer.

Professionals who have signed up in the apllication can manage information about their education and professional
experience, make requests to connect with other professionals and accept or reject
connection requests, supervise and manage the network of those connected to them
professionals, post articles that can contain images, and post
respond to ads. They can also read in their timeline the articles posted by
other professionals, having the opportunity to comment on them, note their interest
for specific posts and are notified of other users' interest in
their posts. They can conduct private discussions with affiliated professionals,
navigate the presentation pages of other professionals and manage the settings of
their connection. 

The application first displays a page in the visitor's browser (Welcome page). This page enables the
user to register in the application by pressing the corresponding button on the bar
navigation. It also allows a user to log in to the application
giving his e-mail address and user password
in the navigation bar. The corresponding HTTP requests are encrypted
via the SSL protocol.

The registration page of a new user requires him to enter a user password,
confirmation of user password, name, surname, e-mail address
mail, contact telephone, photograph and some other information.
If there is a user with the same email address
mail, the application will display an appropriate message and the registration process will
terminated.

After a user enters the application he will navigate to the home page. Above
part of the home page there is a bar with the following options: Home Page / Network /
Ads / Discussions / Notifications / Personal Information / Format Settings
activated or not tabs. The left part of the page contains a box from where
the user can navigate his personal data as well as his network. In the
center section of the page exists the timeline of the professional, where
the articles posted by him and other professionals are displayed in chronological order.
One is able to add comments or like a post.
Moreover, there exists a text and multimedia input box, where he can post a new article.

By selecting the "Network" tab, the user precedes the Network page, where
the related professionals are displayed in a grid format
(name, photo, professional position). Choosing with
mouse one of the logged in professionals, the user can send a friend request to him. 
There is also a searchbar to find professionals who have
subscribed to the application.

By selecting the "Ads" tab the user sees the ads they have published
affiliated professionals and may choose to apply for
jobs concerned. He can also post his own ads and
examine the applications that other professionals have made to them. 
 
Selecting the "Discussions" tab one can chat with other professionals that are currently
online and have joined in the chat room.

Selecting the "Notifications" tab displays a page that contains
connection requests which can be accepted or rejected by the
user. 

Selecting the "Personal Information" tab displays a page where the user can
enter his professional experience, information about his education
and his skills. 

Selecting the "Settings" tab displays a page where the user can change
his e-mail address and password to the application.
